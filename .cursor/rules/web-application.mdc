# Web Application Structure

## Overview
The web application is built using Flask with SQLAlchemy for database interactions and Flask-WTF for form handling.

## Main Components

### Templates
The `/app/templates` directory contains all HTML templates using Jinja2 templating engine.

### Static Assets
The `/app/static` directory is organized as follows:
- `/css` - Stylesheets
- `/js` - JavaScript files
- `/audio` - Audio files for the web interface

### Services
The `/app/services` directory contains backend service modules:
- Translation services using OpenAI
- Audio generation services
- User management services

### Utilities
The `/app/utils` directory contains helper functions and utility modules.

## Database
The application uses SQLite via SQLAlchemy with models defined in the app structure.

## Routes
Flask routes are defined within the app package to handle different URL endpoints.

## Configuration
Application configuration is managed through [config.py](mdc:config.py) and environment variables in [.env](mdc:.env).
